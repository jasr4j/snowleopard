### Barebones

A simple OS kernel written in mostly C and Assembly. This should be able to load itself on x86 machines in 32-bit. 

Compiled using GCC Cross-Compiler and tested on QEMU. 

This is from the OSDev Wiki Barebones Tutorial on the Hello World x86 Kernel. 


### Simple Memory Allocators (Now Moved from [small-projects](https://github.com/jasr4j/small-projects/))

Linear - Can only reset, but is very lightweight and fast

Stack - Last In First Out Memory Allocator with a few additions

Heap - Dynamic Memory Allocation (with a static maximum amount of memory)
